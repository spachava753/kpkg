# kpkg
A binary to install various K8s ecosystem related binaries. Heavily inspired by arkade

I really like [arkade](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade). It solved my problem of installing a bunch of different binaries that are either necessary, helpful, or both while working with the Kubernetes ecosystem. However, it was missing a couple of features that I would have loved to have. This is my solution to the problem that arkade solves.
